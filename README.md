# Book NodeJS API

An Api built with nodejs where you can perform CRUD operations.

## What I learnt

Used Express to create a rest API
Created and API to
POST a new book
GET A single book
PUT ie update a book
DELETE a book
PATCH a book(update a detail about a book).

Each API response was accompanied with the appropriate status code and json response.

Created a Mongodb database to store a collection of books
Created a mongodb schema to ensure the database recieve correct data
